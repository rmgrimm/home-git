# Home Directory Settings

This repository holds common settings I like to have version-controlled or shared across
systems. Different common environments are held in separate branches of this repository.

## Available Branches

The available branches include:

 * [crostini/fedora](https://github.com/rmgrimm/home-git/tree/crostini/fedora) - for use with Fedora on ChromeOS's Crostini linux container
 * [old](https://github.com/rmgrimm/home-git/tree/old) - the branch containing all my old configs before reorganizing

## Using

Each branch will include environment-specific instructions for how to set up the home directory
with the settings contained in the repository and then start tracking changes.
